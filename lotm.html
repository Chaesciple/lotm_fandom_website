        <h1>Pathways to Divine</h1>
        <p>
            A Pathway <i>(途径, Tújìng)</i>, or Path of the Divine <i>(神之途径, Shén zhī tújìng)</i>, corresponds to a series of 10 named potion formulas that give access to supernatural and mystical powers. Once a being has drunk a potion, they become a Beyonder of that pathway. Each pathway belongs to a group containing one or more neighboring pathways, which a Beyonder can safely switch within at High-Sequence. At the end of each pathway, only one Beyonder can attain divinity and become the True God of that pathway.
